Ay
Turn my beat up a little bit yo
For real, I was iIwas
Oh, it's gonna get louder?
Alright cool

She keep on gettin played like its recess
Breaking hearts a reflex
She wants to hit the beach and show her t- down in Key West
Someone leave her crying all the time and now she finally out of Kleenex
Sick of dudes not giving her the respect
'Cause really she a genius, a CEO tryin to be on top alone

She don't keep them close
She been waiting for the opportunity to be a boss, tough b-
Probably would have thought she played lacrosse
Sick of being soft with her heart broken all the time
Want some money, too
Dudes are fallin' all in love with who, was nothin' new
Only coming through to bust a n- or two

She just needs her family like the Huxtables
And now she on the road, left them home to takeover
Get rich and have her crib madeover
But she gonna do it partyin' with her cup full
Ain't gon' trust you, but she gonna f- you

She wants diamonds, she wants gold
But she's scared to let you get too close
And she's been high, and she's been low
But now she's finally on her own
And they've been lookin'
So they been finding
'Cause she ain't grinding
And she ain't hiding
Until she finds her way back home
And then she's finally all alone

She gonna be rich as f-
In high school they were callin' her a s-
But now she coming up, Louis Vuitton and Juicy on her butt
See the b- that be hatin' like "What's up?"
'Cause they ain't doing nothing, and she out here stuntin'

Middle finger to them h-, all them b-had it comin'
Yeah, on top of the world, she lookin' down
Invite you to the crib, let you look around
Just a f- tease tryna get your cheese
Invite you out to dinner, 'cause she want to eat for free
She could pay if she wanted to, she won't though
Go home, she got more dough

She wants diamonds, she wants gold
But she;s scared to let you get too close
And she's been high, and she's been low
But now she's finally on her own
And they've been lookin'
So they been finding
'Cause she ain't grinding
And she ain't hiding
Until she finds her way back home
And then she's finally all alone

She wants diamonds, she wants gold
But she's scared to let you get too close
And she's been high, and she's been low
But now she's finally on her own
And they've been lookin'
So they been finding
'Cause she ain't grinding
And she ain't hiding
Until she finds her way back home
And then she's finally all alone

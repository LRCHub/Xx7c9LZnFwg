If the TEC ain't lookin' right I'm bout' to throw it out
If my bitch ain't lookin' right I'm bout' to throw her out
I'm Paul Walker hoppin' out the Porsche now
911 thuggin' with my bros now
Shooters with me too, you better watch what you say
Money nothing to me, bought Margielas today
You saw me in my Coupe and you got jealous today
My bitch be doing tricks with me like Cirque du Soleil
If the TEC ain't lookin' right I'm bout' to throw it out
If my bitch ain't lookin' right I'm bout' to throw her out
I'm Paul Walker hoppin' out the Porsche now
911 thuggin' with my bros now
Shooters with me too, you better watch what you say
Money nothing to me, bought Margielas today
You saw me in my Coupe and you got jealous today
My bitch be doing tricks with me like Cirque du Soleil
Throw you out the Double Tree
Love was never made for me
You can kiss my n-u-t's
Knock you out like Mr. T
I got the force, I got the horses
Whippin' around, clippin' my bitch
Fuck a distortion, she swallow me now
It's nothing but the truth
I'm Barry Bonds, I got the juice
911 rolling through
It's up to me, not up to you
If the feds watching Imma throw it out, pick it up, and then stash it
Time to see me do damage
My baby pussy Atlantis
I'm underwater, no Scuba Steve
This underground, it ain't new to me
I'm behind the scenes, now it's front the curtain
I'm cocky with it, I'm In third person
Mike The Magician go hard as a bitch
I met my shawty when I was a jit
Now she got gold up on both of her wrists
I feel like R. Kelly when I take piss
Damn, now It's fuck promoters at the venues
Now it's five diamond rated menus, waiter know he getting paid too
My opposition can't stand me, now I know who my family
My diamonds look like they Japanese
That's why they can't understand me
If the TEC ain't lookin' right I'm bout' to throw it out
If my bitch ain't lookin' right I'm bout' to throw her out
I'm Paul Walker hoppin' out the Porsche now
911 thuggin' with my bros now
Shooters with me too, you better watch what you say
Money nothing to me, bought Margielas today
You saw me in my Coupe and you got jealous today
My bitch be doing tricks with me like Cirque du Soleil
If the TEC ain't lookin' right I'm bout' to throw it out
If my bitch ain't lookin' right I'm bout' to throw her out
I'm Paul Walker hoppin' out the Porsche now
911 thuggin' with my bros now
Shooters with me too, you better watch what you say
Money nothing to me, bought Margielas today
You saw me in my Coupe and you got jealous today
My bitch be doing tricks with me like Cirque du Soleil
